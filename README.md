# CommunoHeal
CommunoHeal is Bridging Healthcare Gaps, One Connection at a Time. It will help manage one of the most crucial problem faced when it comes to healthcare, i.e., improper allocation of healthcare professionals. 

CommunoHeal provides remote video consultations where patients first interact with nurses for initial assessment, and if necessary, are seamlessly connected to specialized doctors. The platform also offers a 24/7 emergency service, ensuring immediate access to medical professionals during critical situations. Users can upload and store medical records securely, allowing healthcare providers to deliver informed care. With AI-driven transcript management, and a user-friendly interface, CommunoHeal makes healthcare more accessible, efficient, and inclusive for communities with limited medical resources.
